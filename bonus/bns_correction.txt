Chapter VIII
Bonus part
Due to its simplicity, this project offers limited opportunities for additional features.
However, why not create your own checker?
Thanks to the checker program, you will be able to check whether
the list of instructions generated by the push_swap program actually
sorts the stack properly.
The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is
perfect. Perfect means the mandatory part has been fully completed
and functions without errors. In this project, this entails
validating all benchmarks without exception. If you have not
passed ALL the mandatory requirements,b your bonus part will not
be evaluated at all.
VIII.1 The "checker" program
Program Name checker
Files to Submit *.h, *.c
Makefile bonus
Arguments stack a: A list of integers
External Function
• read, write, malloc, free,
exit
• ft_printf or any equivalent
YOU coded
Libft authorized Yes
Description Execute the sorting instructions

Push_swap Because Swap_push doesn’t feel as natural
• Write a program named checker that takes as an argument the stack a formatted
as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack (be careful
about the order). If no argument is given, it stops and displays nothing.
• It will then wait and read instructions from the standard input, with each instruction followed by ’\n’. Once all the instructions have been read, the program has to
execute them on the stack received as an argument.
• If after executing those instructions, the stack a is actually sorted and the stack b
is empty, then the program must display "OK" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard
output.
• In every other case, it must display "KO" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard output.
• In case of error, you must display "Error" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard error. Errors include for example: some arguments are not integers, some arguments
are bigger than an integer, there are duplicates, an instruction doesn’t exist and/or
is incorrectly formatted.

You DO NOT have to reproduce the exact same behavior as the provided
binary. It is mandatory to manage errors but it is up to you to
decide how you want to parse the arguments.

Chapter IX
Submission and peer-evaluation
Submit your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the names of
your files to ensure they are correct.
As these assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to organize your files
as you wish, as long as you turn in the mandatory files and comply with the requirements.
During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested. This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or
rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
While this step may not be applicable to every project, you must be prepared for it
if it is mentioned in the evaluation guidelines.
This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g.,
your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes — unless a specific
timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation.
You can, for example, be asked to make a small update to a function or script, modify a
display, or adjust a data structure to store new information, etc.
The details (scope, target, etc.) will be specified in the evaluation guidelines and may
vary from one evaluation to another for the same project.

Bonus
Reminder : Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault, nor other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag. This rule is active throughout the whole defence. We will look at your bonuses if and only if your mandatory part is EXCELLENT. This means that you must complete the mandatory part, beginning to end, and your error management needs to be flawless, even in cases of twisted or bad usage. So if the mandatory part didn't score all the point during this defence bonuses will be totally IGNORED.

Checker program - Error management

In this section, we'll evaluate the checker's error management.
If at least one fails, no points will be awarded for this
section. Move to the next one.

Run checker with non numeric parameters. The program must
display "Error".

Run checker with a duplicate numeric parameter. The program
must display "Error".

Run checker with only numeric parameters including one greater
than MAXINT. The program must display "Error".

Run checker without any parameters. The program must not
display anything and give the prompt back.

Run checker with valid parameters, and write an action that
doesn't exist during the instruction phase. The program must
display "Error".

Run checker with valid parameters, and write an action with
one or several spaces before and/or after the action during
the instruction phase. The program must display "Error".


Yes

No
Checker program - False tests

In this section, we'll evaluate the checker's ability to manage
a list of instructions that doesn't sort the list. Execute the
following 2 tests. If at least one fails, no points will be
awarded for this section. Move to the next one.

Don't forget to press CTRL+D to stop reading during the
intruction phase.

Run checker with the following command "$>./checker 0 9 1 8 2
7 3 6 4 5" then write the following valid action list "[sa,
pb, rrr]". Checker should display "KO".

Run checker with a valid list as parameter of your choice then
write a valid instruction list that doesn't order the
integers. Checker should display "KO". You'll have to
specifically check that the program wasn't developed to only
answer correctly on the test included in this scale. You
should repeat this test couple of times with several
permutations before you validate it.


Yes

No
Checker program - Right tests

In this section, we'll evaluate the checker's ability to manage
a list of instructions that sort the list. Execute the following
2 tests. If at least one fails, no points will be awarded for
this section. Move to the next one.

Don't forget to press CTRL+D to stop reading during the
instruction phase.

Run checker with the following command "$>./checker 0 1 2"
then press CTRL+D without writing any instruction. The program
should display "OK".

Run checker with the following command "$>./checker 0 9 1 8 2"
then write the following valid action list "[pb, ra, pb, ra,
sa, ra, pa, pa]". The program should display "OK".

Run checker with a valid list as parameter of your choice then
write a valid instruction list that order the integers.
Checker must display "OK". You'll have to specifically check
that the program wasn't developed to only answer correctly on
the test included in this scale. You should repeat this test
couple of times with several permutations before you validate
it.
